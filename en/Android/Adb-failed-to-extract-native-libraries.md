# Adb failed to extract native libraries

### Apk Installation Failed
  Have you ever run into a problem on your Android phone like this.
```
  Ã— App not installed.
```
  Your phone won't install the apk you've just downloaded and the explanation you demand is nowhere to be found.  
  This might happened a lot if you're a fan for sideloads and your phone is out-dated. Because along with new versions of Android and APIs issued every year by Google, new apps or updated ones may have a higher minimum system API level requirement. This then stops you from using the apks.  
  This requirement can be easily found in AndroidManifest.xml.  
```xml
  <uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="28"
            android:targetSdkVersion="28" />
```
  Other possible reasons like signature or permission problem will not be discussed in this article.  
  Anyway, many may know that none of these "for-new-phone" apps can be installed on old system platforms, but few understand why it would also happen in some other special situations. First, when there is a flaw in a customized or rooted ROMs and somehow files belonging to that app weren't deleted completely during last unintallation, a re-install will cause prompting this. The other situation, however, is due to the apk file and its developer. This article focuses on the latter one.  

### 'adb install'
Adb: Failure [INSTALL_FAILED_INVALID_APK: Failed to extract native libraries, res=-2]
  If you try to look for a reason by `adb install`, you may get notified with this error message. Seemed weird to many people, it shows that there is something wrong with the `.so` files, i.e. libraries. The best part is that it actually can be fixed easily if you know what to check.  
```xml
  <application android:allowBackup="false" 
               android:directBootAware="true" 
               **_android:extractNativeLibs="false"_**
               android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher" 
               android:label="@string/app_name" 
               android:name="com.meizu.mznfcpay.MeizuPayApp"
               android:resizeableActivity="false"
               android:supportsRtl="true"
               android:theme="@style/AppTheme">
```
