# \_michaelx\_ @ CornerStudio - Introduction

## What is this place?
- This my Github Pages blog.

- I put down all my expedition inside the digital wonderland here, served as a record for me and anyone who is interested.
- I notch every mistake I made when striding across the plaza Fermi, showing you how cruel the reality is between the GAPs.

- Github said， "Build my own site from scratch"， and so I'm here.
